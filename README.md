##This the Brain Tumor Prediction model Using Deep Learning(CNN) ##There are Four Steps In doing this ##First we have to build cnn and fit cnn to the images ##This Model Is a Basic model with less no of images ot train ##Step1 : Applying convolution to the layer by applying relu activation function. ##Step2 : Then max pooling to it. ##Step3 : Then by applying flattening to max pooling step to give them as input to neural network ##Step4 : Then we canstruct a fully connected layer same as artificial neural network.We will use a very small dataset because It takes lot of time for execution.
